Decentralized Virtual Power Plant

This repository contains the code for a decentralized virtual power plant that manages up to 2 megawatts of distributed energy resources from wind, solar, battery storage and natural gas. The virtual power plant is in support of demand side response management and focuses on load balancing, load shifting, and curtailment operations for enterprises.

Features
The virtual power plant integrates into our blockchain marketplace using the Hedera network, allowing users to buy, sell, and bid on carbon credits, excess energy production, and renewable energy credits. The virtual power plant pulls data from 3rd party software for weather, electricity pricing, tariffs, and open market platforms.

The code for the decentralized virtual power plant is written in Node.js and deployed on AWS cloud with a focus on energy reduction and uses unique computational engineering. The virtual power plant has the functionality to commit to GitHub and run in Codespaces.

Getting Started
To run the virtual power plant, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Run npm install to install all dependencies
Run npm start to start the virtual power plant
Why Decentralized Virtual Power Plant?
A decentralized virtual power plant offers several benefits for reaching net-zero goals and increasing participation in the energy market. By utilizing a decentralized ledger, such as the Hedera network, transactions and data are stored in a secure and transparent manner, reducing the risk of fraudulent activity. Additionally, the decentralized architecture allows for greater participation in the energy market, as smaller players, such as households and communities, can participate in energy production and sales.

Furthermore, the virtual power plant's focus on energy reduction and use of unique computational engineering allows for more efficient and cost-effective management of energy resources, ultimately leading to a more sustainable energy future. The integration of a blockchain marketplace for the buying, selling, and trading of carbon credits, excess energy production, and renewable energy credits further supports the transition to a more sustainable energy future.
